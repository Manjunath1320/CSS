        CSS</h1>
    <p style="color: goldenrod;">
        Inline CSS is the technique to define the single element with the insert style sheets in an HTML document. We
        can add CSS in three approaches: Inline, Internal, and External. It has the interactive and unique style to
        create a single HTML element; we can define the inline CSS on the style attribute.
    </p>
    <p style="font-weight: 200;color: red;">
        What is inline block CSS?
        display: inline-block brought a new way to create side by side boxes that collapse and wrap properly depending
        on the available space in the containing element. It makes layouts that were previously accomplished with floats
        easier to create. No need to clear floats anymore

        Where is inline CSS?
        Inline CSS places the CSS inside an HTML tag and affects only that element. Internal CSS is placed inside a
        style    element,  which goes inside the head of the HTML document.
