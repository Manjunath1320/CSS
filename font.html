    <h1>This is a Seventh assignment about Font properties</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages â€” for example, to alter the font, color, size,
        and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

        What are the 3 types of CSS?

        The three types of CSS are external, internal, and inline. External CSS is a file that HTML files will link to.
        Internal CSS is specified at the beginning of an HTML document. Inline CSS is written for a specific element in
        the HTML document
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS offers several features that make it simple and effective to specify different text styles, including color,
        alignment, spacing, decoration, transformation, etc. Several frequently used text properties include text-align,
        text-decoration, text-transform, text-indent, line-height, letter-spacing, and word-spacing.
