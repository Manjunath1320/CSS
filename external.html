    <p>
        External CSS is a form of CSS which is used to add styling to multiple HTML pages at a time. It helps to design
        the layout of many HTML web pages simultaneously. The external CSS is always saved with the . css extension, and
        through this file, we can change the complete style of our HTML web page.
