<h1>This is a 13th assignment tells about different type of positions</h1>

<h2>position: sticky;</h2>
<div class="sticky">I am sticky!</div>
<div>
  <p>In this example, the sticky element sticks to the top of the page (top: 0),
     when you reach its scroll position.</p>
 
</div>


<h2>position: static;</h2>
<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; 
    it is always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>
<div class="static">
<img src="educ.jpg">
</div>

<h2>position: relative;</h2>
<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>
<div class="relative">
<img src="educ.jpg">
</div>

<h2>position: fixed;</h2>
<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means
     it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>
<div class="fixed">
    <img src="educ.jpg">
</div>


<h2>position: absolute;</h2>
<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest 
    positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>
    <div class="absolute">
        <img src="educ.jpg">
</div>
